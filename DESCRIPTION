Title: Read the 'FlyMovieFormat' (fmf) video format
Version: 0.1
Date: 2016-05-25
Author: Gregory Jefferis

Description: R support for the 'FlyMovieFormat' video originally developed by
    Andrew Straw and colleagues, initially at Caltech. Presently this provides
    functions to read and parse the intial header of a 'fmf' file and then to
    read individual images frames and timestamp information. 'fmf' files are
    frequently used as intermediates for analysis of fly behaviour.
